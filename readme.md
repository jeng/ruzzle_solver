##Ruzzle Solver##

If you like cheating at games here is a Ruzzle solver.  

It uses a backtracking algorithm to try every path.  With the data indexed this runs really fast.

`Word.lst` came as data from some old ita puzzles.  It appears to be fairly complete.

`prefix.idx` gets created from words_stats.py
